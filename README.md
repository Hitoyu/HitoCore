#HitoCore
API library for my plugins.

Not too hard to use, and contains useful methods (including a debug system). My plugins will make use of this, and therefore this is essential for them to run properly.

##Dependancies for compiling
BUKKIT! I recommend using bukkit-1.9.2-R0.1.jar as your Bukkit build. If you do not use that version of Bukkit, you MUST state what you did use in your pull request.
